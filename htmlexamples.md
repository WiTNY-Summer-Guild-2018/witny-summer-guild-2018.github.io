### Other sites with even more examples

* [Tutorial Republic resources](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-examples.php) - This is the same site that the CodeLAB tool is from, so it will look familiar
* [w3Schools resources](https://www.w3schools.com/Html/) - CAREFUL -- this tool LOOKS a lot like CodeLAB, but it is VERY easy to lose your work with this website. You can check out the examples here, but you should make sure to paste them into the **CodeLAB** tool you are using.

#### Note

You can "nest" tags, or use pairs of tags together, but this can get complicated and confusing -- remember, always change one thing and then try it, talk through it, draw things out, and ask for help if you are confused about how something works.
