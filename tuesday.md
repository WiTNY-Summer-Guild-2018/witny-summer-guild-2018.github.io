## DAY 2 - Users & Data!

Today is a completely different perspective on product development in technology!

We're going to spend this week going through a bunch of the process involved in technology product development.

And a big piece of that process -- is about figuring out what the potential users of your product want and need!

So in doing so, you're going to talk to real people in NYC -- here in Times Square -- and then analyze the data you get from them to help you figure out what kind of technology product you want to come up with, as a team!

This is a lot more complicated than it *might* seem at first...

### **YOUR CHALLENGE:**
### *How might we make transportation in New York City better?*

We're going to consider this question in a few different ways today.

### What is "user experience"?

* User Experience ("UX") research
* User Experience ("UX") design

### Break apart the challenge - Exercise

* **How might we**
  * Not about "can"
  * Not about "will"
  * About dreamed up possibility!
  * This helps us identify the problems...
  * And we'll come back to this tomorrow (Wednesday), too!

* **What does "better" even mean?** What are more specific words for what it could mean?
  * In your team, come up with at least five things it could mean. For example, "faster for people to get where they want to go"? You should try to be as specific as possible.
  * Write each one on a post-it note and collect them on your table!
  * We're going to share them afterward, so choose a spokesperson from your team to share them!

* **What could "transportation" refer to?**
  * In your team, come up with at least five different things it could refer to. For example, "the subway system".
  * Any amount of being specific is fine!
  * Write each one on a post-it note (use a different color from the "better") and collect them on the table!
  * We'll be sharing these, too.

* What kind of specific question(s) should you ask?
* What information do you need to know?
* What kind of data is necessary to answer our questions?
* What kind of data can we actually get?

### Asking questions (of people)

* How do you build a question -- that can help you to determine a problem to try solving?

  * **Think about what you really want to know.** You want to know specific stuff, right?

    * For example, you might not need to know whether or not a person *likes* the bus system -- you want to know specific things they like, or dislike, or find funny, or want more of, or want less of... "I love the bus system!" or "I don't really like the bus system..." isn't that useful without why.

  * **Try to make the question as easy to answer as possible.** In general, people -- especially people you're surveying or asking questions off the street -- don't want to "think too much" about answering, so ideally, you come up with a question or two that is really easy and quick to answer.

    * For example,


* How do you select a question?
* How do you approach people to ask a question?
* How do you take notes on people's answers?



### Practice asking questions...

[Practice framework](day_2_exercise_2.md)

### TIMES SQUARE! @ 11:00 am

* Each team with more than 3 people should separate into 2 groups of max 3 people
* We have [another algorithm]() to determine which way your team's groups should go...

* Head out for 2 hours -- **you should come back here by 1:00 pm for lunch!**
