Today is a completely different perspective on the process of product development in technology.

A big piece of that process is about figuring out what the potential users of your product want and need, and gathering other perspectives -- aside from your own.

In doing so, you're going to talk to real people in NYC -- here in Times Square -- and then analyze the data you get from them to help you figure out what kind of technology product you want to come up with, as a team!

This is a little more complicated than it *might* seem at first... but you'll be well prepared.

[SLIDES FOR TODAY](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OlTH8kkR7CzZ564hf344di-wISrwKOcO/view?usp=sharing) -  [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OlTH8kkR7CzZ564hf344di-wISrwKOcO/view?usp=sharing) are the slides for today.


### What is "user experience"? (~ 5 min)

* User Experience ("UX") research -- **intercept testing** (today)
* User Experience ("UX") design

### **YOUR CHALLENGE**

We'll consider a question in a few different ways today.

### User Research process

* Break down vocabulary and brainstorm specific **topics**.
* Examine questions -- what does it mean to make a **good question**?
* Define your own **questions**.
* **Prepare** to ask your questions: learn **strategies** for approaching and talking to people and for taking notes, "specifying the ask", & practice in a more comfortable environment (right here!).
* Go ask your questions -- **Intercept testing!**
* **Analyze** the qualitative data you've gathered.
* Find **themes** and identify problems or possible improvements.

#### As a user researcher:
* What kind of specific question(s) should you ask?
* What information do you need or want to know?
* What kind of data is necessary to answer our questions?
* What kind of data can we actually get?

### Building questions

[Building new questions - A reference you can check out](building_qs.md)

### Preparing for intercept testing

**Pick your starting role:**

- QUESTION ASKER
- NOTE TAKER

You'll trade off! So don't get too comfortable.

And we'll be talking a little bit about ways to do each one so you feel comfortable and prepared.
