Today is a completely different perspective on the process of product development in technology.

A big piece of that process is about figuring out what the potential users of your product want and need, and gathering other perspectives -- aside from your own.

In doing so, you're going to talk to real people in NYC -- here in Times Square -- and then analyze the data you get from them to help you figure out what kind of technology product you want to come up with, as a team!

This is a little more complicated than it *might* seem at first... but you'll be well prepared.

[HERE](linktbd.md) are the slides for today.


### What is "user experience"? (~ 5 min)

* User Experience ("UX") research -- **intercept testing** (today)
* User Experience ("UX") design

### **YOUR CHALLENGE**

We'll consider a question in a few different ways today.

### User Research process

* Break down vocabulary of your more general challenge/concern.
* Examine questions -- what does it mean to make a good question?
* Define your own questions.
* Prepare to ask your questions: learn strategies for approaching and talking to people and for taking notes, "specifying the ask", & practice in a more comfortable environment (right here!).
* Go ask your questions -- Intercept testing!
* Analyze the qualitative data you've gathered.
* Find themes and identify problems or possible improvements.

**As a user researcher:**
* What kind of specific question(s) should you ask?
* What information do you need to know?
* What kind of data is necessary to answer our questions?
* What kind of data can we actually get?

### Building questions

[Building new questions - A reference you can check out](building_qs.md)

#### Selecting questions

####  A reference you can check out

### Preparing

**Pick your starting role:**

- QUESTION ASKER
- NOTE TAKER

You'll trade off! So don't get too comfortable.

And we'll be talking a little bit about ways to do each one so you feel comfortable and prepared.

### Ready, set ...

We'll send you out in pairs, separated by a minute or so. We'll tell you what direction to go!

### TIMES SQUARE!

* **Any concerns or questions or need a staff member / help, call: [SEE NUMBER] to reach Jackie!**

### ~ Lunch ~

### Analyzing data from users

* **Organizing your notes & gathering qualitative data**

  * Translate notes to *observation* post-its

* **Affinity Diagramming exercise**

* **Select & summarize problem themes**

### For later on if you like: Introduction to qualitative vs quantitative data

* Quant vs Qual - why do we care?

* Data... it means all kinds of things.

  * [Visualization of NYC subway data](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2016/12/visualizing-a-full-day-on-the-new-york-city-subway/510020/)

  * [Entries and exits of NYC subways](http://piratefsh.github.io/mta-maps/public/)

  * [And ALL kinds of NYC transit visualization...](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/04/groove-out-to-24-hours-of-new-york-transit-with-the-multimodal-symphony/522633/)

  * Or even a small amount of data in a spreadsheet, that you could make a chart out of:
