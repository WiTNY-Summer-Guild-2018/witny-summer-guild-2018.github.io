## DAY 2 - Users & Data!

Today is a completely different perspective on product development in technology!

We're going to spend this week going through a bunch of the process involved in technology product development.

And a big piece of that process -- is about figuring out what the potential users of your product want and need!

So in doing so, you're going to talk to real people in NYC -- here in Times Square -- and then analyze the data you get from them to help you figure out what kind of technology product you want to come up with, as a team!

This is a lot more complicated than it *might* seem at first...

### **YOUR CHALLENGE:**
### *How might we make transportation in New York City better?*

We're going to consider this question in a few different ways today.

### Asking questions (of data, of ideas)

* What does "better" even mean?
* What kind of specific question(s) should you ask?
* What information do you need to know?
* What kind of data is necessary to answer our questions?
* What kind of data can we actually get?

### Asking questions (of people)

* How do you build a question?
* How do you select a question?
* How do you take notes on people's answers?

#### Introducing...
* Maura Youngman, Lead of User Insight and Strategy at the New York Times


### Practice asking questions...

### TIMES SQUARE! @ 11:00 am

* Each team with more than 3 people should separate into 2 groups of max 3 people
* We have [another algorithm]() to determine which way your team's groups should go...

* Head out for 2 hours -- **you should come back here by 1:00 pm for lunch!**
