[BACK TO THURSDAY](https://witny-summer-guild-2018.github.io/thursday)

Remember the [JavaScript exercises](day_1_exercise_3.md) we practiced on Monday? Here are a few more!

In your teams, find a coding partner.

With your coding partner(s), go through each of these exercises until it's your team's turn to talk to the instructor about your Standup plan for the day -- we'll all go over them together after everyone has gone through standup, and they'll help you get on your metaphorical feet and practice skills that'll be helpful as you think about the rest of the day!

For each exercise, you should:

* Talk it through with your coding partner(s) and make sure you're on the same page about what the exercise is asking and what it means.

* Read the questions: what's your goal?

* If there's anything that is confusing, think about how you could try it out! Does reading through the rest of the exercise help? Does going to look at what you did [on Monday](monday.md) help at all?

* Whenever you change something in code, in the online tool or in a file, make a prediction about what will happen as a result of that change. Then try it out, either by looking at the online tool, or opening the file in a web browser!
  * Were you right about your prediction? Were you wrong?
  * Write that down -- right or wrong, and what you were expecting vs what happened -- on a piece of paper, or a dry erase board..! This kind of making predictions, getting them wrong, changing your mind -- is key to learning about JavaScript, or any kind of programming!

* Each exercise asks you to try something specific and/or find answer(s) to question(s). The most important part, though, is to talk about it! It's easy to be incorrect about what needs to change, what is wrong, what the answer is -- but that's part of the detective process of coding. Being able to talk about it with others is a huge deal.

* **Recommendation:** we've given you links to the same online tool you used on Monday -- we recommend this just for trying stuff out, but remember, whatever you do in the online tool, you could also write and save in your own file in a text editor!
