## How to host your website on GitHub

You're going to be hosting what is called  "static site". Your static site has complexity -- if you use


1. Click on that plus in the corner https://www.dropbox.com/s/qcbp4nzrffwvb7d/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.04.26.png?dl=0 and click new repository

2. You should see something like this https://www.dropbox.com/s/m26fj2kh0m0twcj/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.22.40.png?dl=0 in that first box, where I have **aerenchyma.github.io** you should put YOUR USER NAME where **aerenchyma** is, but the rest MUST be the same. So if your username is **awesomecoder18**, then it should be **awesomecoder18.github.io**, for example. **Don't continue yet! One more thing to do!**

3. You should also click the box for **Initialize repository with README**, like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3q9o6g4rgflbeul/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.32.15.png?dl=0 **This is important!**  If you forget, don't worry, we can delete it and go back and do it again. But everything else on that page should be the same -- don't change anything! You can put something in the description box if you want, but you do not have to. Don't click any *other* buttons or boxes.

4. Click the green **Create repository** button at the bottom of the page, like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sv9cmxa6eladk7t/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.25.00.png?dl=0

5. Now you should see something like this. https://www.dropbox.com/s/rig6hfu8ubbt6ls/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.33.01.png?dl=0 Whoa! Lots of stuff. A lot of it you can ignore for now -- it has to do with all the other cool coding-related stuff you can learn to do with GitHub.

6. What we care about is the little **Upload files** button, like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/s7fni3not4a6juu/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.33.39.png?dl=0 Click on that!

7. You should now see something like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/j0hfdm0dp1sp0qx/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.34.58.png?dl=0

8. Click **Choose your files**: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hem8jkavoowggqr/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.35.11.png?dl=0

9. Now select the file you want from your file system, just like you've seen before when you opened a file in the browser or in Sublime Text.

  a. You want to go find whichever `.html` file you want to put on your website. So if it's the one you've been working on today, find that one! If it's the one from Monday, you want the one you saved on Monday with the website code in it!

10. Click the Commit Changes button at the bottom, which is putting your file into the GitHub space for it: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2zs6tzcspd12oeh/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.38.31.png?dl=0

11. You will probably see something like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sm206nf8osacsqa/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.37.48.png?dl=0

12. Then, something like this! https://www.dropbox.com/s/nf5ei0h1bmzozld/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.38.55.png?dl=0 where that second file is the file you just uploaded! Wow.
