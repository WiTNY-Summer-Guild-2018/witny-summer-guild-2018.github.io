## How to Create a GitHub Account

### What is GitHub?

A service online that lets you upload and save code and host websites.

### How to create your account

1. Go to the website https://github.com/ in your web browser (for example, Google Chrome)

2. You should now see something like this: ![Image of GitHub welcome screen](https://www.dropbox.com/s/awxkea1rukpplvm/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2017.57.03.png)

3. Choose the username you want and type it in the Username box, and type in your email and a password as it instructs you to. This is the name that goes with your ACCOUNT -- not your new website. It's a bit like how your email has a username, but you still get to make a lot of different subjects for each of your emails. IMPORTANT:

  a. You can choose any user name you want, but **your username will be in the URL of your website**, so choose one that you want to share that is easy to type! Some people like to use the same as their email. Some people use something different.

  b. No spaces in your username, just like email usernames. You can have hyphens in between, like this: `witny-summer-guild`. It will also have to be **unique** -- everyone's on GitHub is different. GitHub will tell you if you're trying to use one that someone else has. You can pick something else, or add a number, etc.

  c. **Make sure to use a real email address that you really use -- you'll have to go verify that it's really you at that email address soon!**

4. You should now see something like this: ![Image after signing in to GitHub](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qvocb82jf8srqyj/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.00.25.png)

5. Click **Continue** at the bottom of that page.

6. Next you should see a questionnaire. You do NOT need to do this. Scroll to the bottom and click **skip this step** -- like this: ![Image of Skip this step text](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lgd8e4ukz6bpyvv/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.01.51.png)

7. Now you should see something like this: ![GitHub welcome](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z9yu6pbaul2yrdu/Screenshot%202018-06-18%2018.02.18.png) Keep this window open -- you're going to keep using it!

8. **Before you can do anything on GitHub, you need to verify your email address.** So open up a new tab or window in the web browser, go to your email, and sign in. You should have gotten an email from GitHub. Follow the instructions in the email to confirm your email. It may have other information -- but don't worry! You don't have to do anything else.

But for this, you're all set. There's a LOT that can be learned about GitHub, but that takes a LONG time. You need the account to set up your website -- to *host* it.
