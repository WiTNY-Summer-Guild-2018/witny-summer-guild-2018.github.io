The 2018 [WiTNY](http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/women-in-technology/) [Summer Guild](http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/women-in-technology/programs/) welcomes groups of women and non-binary students who have been admitted to CUNY for Fall 2018. You will spend your week learning about possibilities in, and awesome things about, Computer Science and related technology topics -- and later this summer/fall, you can enroll in a computer science course at your CUNY campus to expand your tech knowledge!
