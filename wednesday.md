Yesterday you were presented with a broad challenge: **How might we make transportation in New York City better?** And after talking to users and talking among yourselves, you identified some problems you are interested in.

Today we're going to look at how you go from that to determining what kind of product to build and look at what it means to be a *designer* in technology.

This is part 1 of the **product design cycle** you'll be doing a super-fast version of today (Wednesday) and tomorrow (Thursday) before demoing your idea as a team on Friday!

[SLIDES FOR TODAY](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18r0icXic5w0dX8awFPwZqPiHraJ1gCsoQs6jIJRY9po/edit?usp=sharing)

### Introductions

* Karla Polo-Garcia, your instructor
* Review from yesterday

### Today you are designers

* Forming questions from problems
* Choosing (a) problem/s to address as a team
* Paper prototyping & wireframes
* Using a prototyping tool to design part of a project
* Prepare to pass an idea to your developers (you, tomorrow!)

### Problem identification

* **Exercise 1** - Translate problems into "How may we/how might we" questions

* **Exercise 2**

    * How much impact could solving this problem have?
    * How could we solve this problem?
    * A chart!

* **Exercise 3** - Brainstorm!!! & Collect ideas for solutions

### Drawing wireframes & user flow

* (1) Find a work partner in your team

* (2) Draw wireframes about how to flow through the application

* (3) Together, select one part you want to focus on to design/prototype

  * One particular wireframe you want to design

  * One particular part of your idea you want to create a couple screens from

### Designers & developers & Minimum Viable Products

* Today you are a designer
* Tomorrow you become a developer

* In preparation, you'll ask: What's the component you want to focus on?
  * Examples
  * Decision-making
  * And in "real life", timelines...

* But as a designer
  * The whole world is open to you! What problem do you want to solve? What do you want to build?

### Introduction to prototyping tool - Figma

  * Example & introduction to prototyping tool

    * We've generated one board per team! To get *your* team's board, check out [this link](week3figmalinks.md).

  * Choosing partial ideas to prototype for each person

  * Collaborating to build 1 team prototype / prototype set

  * We'll go through a Figma tutorial!

### ~ Lunch ~

### Time to prototype!

#### Planning

Grab a partner for prototyping -- to work on one aspect of the wireframes you worked on before.

You can decide in your team whether your groups will split up to prototype different parts of your idea, or whether to all prototype the same parts in different ways so you can consider different ideas when you start developing!

Anything is fine -- this is a time for ideas and trying things out!

#### Prototyping

Get started working with Figma in your partners, making comments, and trying stuff out --

To build prototypes of the idea(s) you've had to improve transportation situations in NYC with technology!

Remember: **Dream big!**

What if you could build anything? We only have time *this* week to start on a tiny bit... but that doesn't mean you can't make big plans.


### 'Standup' part 1 (20 min)

* Come up with a standup summary in your team!

### Conclusion & exit tickets
