Yesterday you were presented with a broad challenge: **How might we make transportation in New York City better?** And after talking to users and talking among yourselves, you identified some problems you are interested in.

Today we're going to look at how you go from that to determining what kind of product to build and look at what it means to be a *designer* in technology.

This is part 1 of the **product design cycle** you'll be doing a super-fast version of today (Wednesday) and tomorrow (Thursday) before presenting your idea as a team on Friday!

### Introductions

* Karla Polo-Garcia, your instructor
* Review from yesterday
* [Slides for today](slides_link_tbd.md)

### Today you are designers

* Forming questions from problems (based on your challenge)
* Choosing (a) problem/s to address as a team
* Paper prototyping & wireframes
* Using a prototyping tool to design part of a project
* Prepare to pass an idea to your developers (you, tomorrow!)

### Problem identification


* [Exercise 1 - What factors need to occur to address this goal?](day_3_exercise_1.md)
* [Exercise 2 - How might we facilitate those factors to become true?](day_3_exercise_2.md)
* [Exercise 3 - Collect ideas for solutions & vote on 'em](day_3_exercise_3.md)

### Drawing wireframes & user flow

[Process for developing and selecting a wireframe to prototype](day_3_exercise_4.md)

### Designers & developers, Minimum Viable Products

* Today you are a designer
* Tomorrow you become a developer
* What's the *first tiny thing* to build?
  * [Examples](day_3_exercise_5.md)
  * Decision-making


### ~ Lunch ~

### Introduction to prototyping tool

* Example & introduction to prototyping tool
* Choosing wireframes to prototype for each person
* Collaborating to build 1 team prototype / prototype set

Remember: Dream big!

What if you could build anything? We only have time *this* week to start on a tiny bit... but that doesn't mean you can't make big plans.

### 'Standup' part 1 (20 min)

* [Come up with a standup summary in your team](day_3_exercise_7.md)
