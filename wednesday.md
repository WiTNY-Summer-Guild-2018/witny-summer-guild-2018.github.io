Yesterday you were presented with a broad challenge: **How might we make transportation in New York City better?** And after talking to users and talking among yourselves, you identified some problems you are interested in.

Today we're going to look at how you go from that to determining what kind of product to build and look at what it means to be a *designer* in technology.

This is part 1 of the **product design cycle** you'll be doing a super-fast version of today (Wednesday) and tomorrow (Thursday) before demoing your idea as a team on Friday!

### Introductions

* Karla Polo-Garcia, your instructor
* Review from yesterday
* [Slides for today](slides_link_tbd.md)

### Today you are designers

* Forming questions from problems (based on your challenge)
* Choosing (a) problem/s to address as a team
* Paper prototyping & wireframes
* Using a prototyping tool to design part of a project
* Prepare to pass an idea to your developers (you, tomorrow!)

### Problem identification

* **Exercise 1** - Translate problems into "How may we/how might we" questions

* **Exercise 2** - Impact vs complexity

    * How much impact could solving this problem have?
    * How complex/difficult would it be to solve this problem?

* **Exercise 3** - Collect ideas for solutions

### Drawing wireframes & user flow

* (1) Find a work partner in your team

* (2) Draw wireframes about how to flow through the application

* (3) Together, select one part you want to focus on to design/prototype

  * One particular wireframe you want to design

  * One particular part of your idea you want to create a couple screens from

### Designers & developers & Minimum Viable Products

* Today you are a designer
* Tomorrow you become a developer

* In preparation, you'll ask: What's the component you want to focus on?
  * Examples
  * Decision-making
  * And in "real life", timelines...

* But as a designer
  * The whole world is open to you! What problem do you want to solve? What do you want to build?

### Introduction to prototyping tool - Figma

[Figma slides](figma_slides_link.md)

  * Example & introduction to prototyping tool
  * Choosing wireframes to prototype for each person
  * Collaborating to build 1 team prototype / prototype set

**TBA** *Instructions for collaborating and saving your prototype!*

### ~ Lunch ~

### Time to prototype!

Remember: Dream big!

What if you could build anything? We only have time *this* week to start on a tiny bit... but that doesn't mean you can't make big plans.
