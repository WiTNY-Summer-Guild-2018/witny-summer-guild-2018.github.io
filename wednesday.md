## DAY 3 - Prototyping!

Yesterday you were presented with a broad challenge: **How might we make transportation in New York City better?** And after talking to users and talking among yourselves, each of your teams found an area or two that you are interested in working on.

We're going to start connecting the coding you saw on Monday to the product ideas and data questions we've been thinking about yesterday and will think about today.

Today is all about brainstorming, based on what you learned and thought about yesterday, and PROTOTYPING -- coming up with an idea and a design -- a product! It's also part 1 of the **product design cycle** you'll be doing a super-fast version of today (Wednesday) and tomorrow (Thursday) before presenting your idea as a team on Friday!
