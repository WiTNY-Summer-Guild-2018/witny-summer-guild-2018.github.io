### What you're doing today

Yesterday you were presented with a broad challenge. After talking to users and talking among yourselves, you identified some themes from your data.

Today we're going to look at how you go from that data-gathering process to determining what kind of product to build and look at what it means to be a *designer* in technology.

This is part 1 of the **product design cycle** you'll be doing a super-fast version of today (Wednesday) and tomorrow (Thursday) before demoing your idea as a team on Friday!

### Introductions

* Karla Polo-Garcia, your instructor
* Your coaches!

### Today you are designers

* Forming questions from problems
