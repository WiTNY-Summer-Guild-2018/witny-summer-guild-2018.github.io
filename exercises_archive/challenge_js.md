## Challenge JavaScript code exercise

```html
<html>
<script>
  function show_day_of_week() {
    var today = new Date();
    var day_of_week = today.getDay();
    alert(day_of_week);
  };
</script>
<body onload="show_day_of_week()">Hello everyone</body>
</html>
```

This code will run. What does it do?

See how some of the lines in the program are building your very own collection of actions called **show_day_of_week**?

You'll see this more on Thursday! DON'T worry if you don't understand this -- this is VERY advanced and NOT needed for today. This kindof idea comes up a few weeks into my college course!
