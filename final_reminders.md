IN ORDER TO WORK ON YOUR PRESENTATION,

**Each TEAM needs to:**

* Make a COPY of this presentation that is YOURS, on YOUR gmail account
* You should RENAME the presentation with your team number and name: e.g. **Team 4 - Ion Sky Presentation**
* You can use any one of your Gmail accounts!
* If no one on your team has a Gmail account, flag Jackie over -- and perhaps your coaches can help!
* If you need help with this step, ask a coach or a instructor for help!
* **Make sure you share the presentation with Jackie:** *jczetta@gmail.com*

## YOUR CHECKLIST FOR THE END OF THE DAY

**We are NOT bringing these same computers to Cornell Tech tomorrow!**

So you need to make sure EVERYTHING you need for your presentation or will want later is online.

You should make sure:

[ ] You have saved your Figma link so you can get back to it! You can find your original team link here: https://witny-summer-guild-2018.github.io/week1figma.html

[ ] You have DOWNLOADED any code you want to save that you made on Code.org Tutorial Republic, and EMAILED the file to yourselves. Saving it on the computer is not enough to keep it, you have to make sure it is online!

[ ] You have taken screenshots (an instructor/TA/coach can help if you don't know how!) of anything you want to show pictures of in your presentation

[ ] You have added stuff to all your presentation slides

[ ] You have shared your presentation with Jackie: **jczetta@gmail.com**
