IN ORDER TO WORK ON YOUR PRESENTATION,

**Each TEAM needs to:**

* Make a COPY of this presentation that is YOURS, on YOUR gmail account
* You should RENAME the presentation with your team number and name or another clear identifier: e.g. **Team 4 - Ion Sky Presentation**
* You can use any one of your Gmail accounts!
* If no one on your team has a Gmail account, flag an instructor over -- and perhaps your coaches can help! If you need help with this step, ask a coach or a instructor for help!
* **Make sure you share the presentation with Jackie:** *jczetta@gmail.com*

## YOUR CHECKLIST FOR THE END OF THE DAY

**We may NOT be using all of these same computers tomorrow!**

So you need to make sure EVERYTHING you need for your presentation or will want later is online, and everything you want to take with you after the week is saved (or emailed to yourself) so you can get it later.

All the *resources* we've made available for you will stay here on the Summer Guild website, which you can always find at **http://bit.ly/sguild2018**.

**You should make sure:**

[] You have saved your Figma link so you can get back to it and/or demo from it tomorrow! You can find your original team link here: https://witny-summer-guild-2018.github.io/week4figmalinks.html

[] You have DOWNLOADED any code you want to save that you made on Code.org Tutorial Republic, and EMAILED the `.html` file that gets downloaded to yourselves. Saving it on the computer is not enough to keep it, you have to make sure it is online!

[] You have ADDED your code `.html` file that you downloded to google drive AND shared it with me (**jczetta@gmail.com**), so you can demo it tomorrow on a NEW computer!

[] You have taken screenshots or photos of anything you want to show pictures of in your presentation -- your affinity diagrams, your paper prototypes, your figma images...

[] You have added stuff to all your demo slides

[] You have links to Figma available or ideas of how to demonstrate what your code does to everyone (don't worry about this -- you'll have some time to think about this together tomorrow!)

[] You have shared your presentation with Jackie: **jczetta@gmail.com**
