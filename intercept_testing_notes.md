### Quick notes on intercept testing

* "Putting your researcher hat on" -- you're occupying a role

* Think about standing somewhere after you walk for a while and counting the people who walk by -- and trying to ask e.g. every 4th person (it's not a choice, it's just a pattern) -- of course, you can always alter the pattern (every third person, a person who looks at you with a lot of curiosity...)

* Make sure you switch off the question-asker vs note-taker roles every couple asks -- hand off the pen and notepad to the other person!

* Don't be afraid to ask "Why do you think that is?" if they give you a short answer and you want more detail. If they walk away or say "I don't know" -- that's okay! No loss for you -- but it almost never hurts to try.

* As the note-taker, it's fine to note context clues as well! What does that mean? If you talk to someone who looks like they're in a hurry, you can note that. If, say, they're carrying a lot of bags and they've just put them down, you could note that. Could clue you in to some interesting stuff.
