## Choose your development adventure

### In your coding groups, you will:

* Look at a bunch of HTML + JavaScript code examples that use jQuery, and try it out.

* Think about the tiny development goal you picked earlier / yesterday.
    * From your startup worksheet!

* Select two of the examples that are similar to things you (might) want to do to start work on your prototype, for the very beginning of the process.

  * You can also talk to other coding groups in your team -- it's OK for two coding groups to choose the same examples to start with, OR to all choose different ones!

  * Note that the examples *are* different levels of complexity. You might want to look through what they do AND look through the code and think about what feels like it might make more sense.

  * Remember it's OK if it's still pretty confusing -- this is a LOT going on! We will help you through it!

* Decide for each of the examples how you might want to *change* them to be more like your small development goal. For example:

  * Do you want it to do the same thing, with a different color?

  * Do you want it to do the same thing, but when you click a button, not when you click on the text itself?

  * Do you want it to go down, instead of up? Or do you want the page to have a button that makes it re-appear as well as a button that makes it disappear?

* Answer [these questions](day4_jquery_questions.md) about each example.

* Edit the code in the online tool example. When you have something you like, or you want to pause and save what you've got, click the downward arrow icon like you did on Day 1 to save what you've got.

* Instructors and coaches will help with any confusion saving files, opening files, and working with the code to change it a little bit!

  * This is super challenging -- and a whole variety of things could happen. You never know! Make sure you keep talking to each other, sharing what works and what doesn't, and talk through questions with coaches, TAs, and instructors!

  * We can help you scope your ideas (decide how much is possible in a short time) and help you figure out what is possible vs what might not be possible without more data or tools that don't exist, so you can get started on a bit of development / problem solving...
