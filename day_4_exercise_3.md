[BACK TO THURSDAY](https://witny-summer-guild-2018.github.io/thursday)

## Choose your development adventure

### In your coding groups, you will:

* Look at a bunch of HTML + JavaScript code examples that use jQuery, and try it out.

* Think about the discussions you had in standup.

* Select one or two (or more) of the examples that are similar to things you (might) want to do to start work on your prototype, for the very beginning of the process.

  * Note that the examples *are* different levels of complexity. You might want to look through what they do AND look through the code and think about what feels like it might make more sense.

  * Remember it's OK if it's still pretty confusing -- this is a LOT going on! We will help you through it!

* Decide for each of the examples how you might want to *change* them to be more like your small feature goals. For example:

* Edit the code in the online tool and try it out -- remember, **change one thing, then try it!** (When you have something you like, or you want to pause and save what you've got before you add more to it, click the downward arrow icon like you did on Day 1 to save what you've got.)

* Instructors and coaches can help with any confusion saving files, opening files, deciding what questions to ask instructors/TAs, and can even help some with working with the code to change it a little bit!

  * This is super challenging -- and a whole variety of things could happen. You never know! Make sure you keep talking to each other, sharing what works and what doesn't, and talk through questions with coaches, TAs, and instructors!

  * We can help you scope your ideas (decide how much is possible in a VERY short time) and help you figure out what is possible vs what might not be possible without more data or tools that don't exist, so you can get started on a bit of development / problem solving...

* **If you decide you would rather spend some of this time building more of your prototype in Figma, that is OK!** You should decide with your team and your coding partner what you want to use this time for, but we encourage you to explore jQuery a little bit -- it's different from what you do in most intro coding classes, but has a lot in common with some such things, and it's really cool.

### Some code examples with jQuery

#### *Approximately* in order of complexity

There are way more available on the internet, but these are good solid examples to start from. Check 'em out and think about what functionality you might want to change, as shown in the example at Summer Guild -- and even what colors and HTML info you might want to change or add to the page!
