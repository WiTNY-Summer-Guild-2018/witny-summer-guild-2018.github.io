## Introduction to HTML

* What's called a "markup language"

  * Not quite the same as a programming language, but a really important part of building stuff that you can see on the internet -- like websites, which you are going to make today!

* A way of designing the structure of a web page

* Any web page you see -- HTML ... AND often a bunch of other stuff making things happen in the background, allowing you to interact with it
  * This week you'll see some of those pieces
  * First, just HTML

* Syntax & syntax errors possible here -- any one character that is wrong *can* cause a problem, so if something is weird, step back and look at what you typed, or ask someone to look at it with you!

* Syntax of "tags" that make structure / formatting / images appear -- they surround data like text

  * [this text is between tags](http://www.google.com)
  * **and so is this text**
  * *and so is this text*
  * <u>and so is this text</u>

  * Or in a couple cases, like images, or line breaks, there's only one tag that *shows* some data... like an image: ![Image of cat](https://images.pexels.com/photos/20787/pexels-photo.jpg?cs=srgb&dl=adorable-animal-cat-20787.jpg)

* A general reference for HTML: https://www.w3schools.com/html/
  * (Coding -- all about looking things up and figuring stuff out -- NOT memorizing)

### HTML helps you work several primary things on web pages

- **Formatting** - making text **bold**, *italic*, <u>underlined</u>...

- **Structure** - making paragraphs in text, line breaks, or lists, like this
  - A key part of programming: Can't take anything for granted, even line breaks!

- Include **images** and **links** in a web page

- **Identify parts** of the page with "ids" and "classes"
  - (So that later on, it's easy to identify part of the web page to change something about it or make something interactive happen to it -- e.g. if you click it, the page turns red!)

- **Styling** the page with **colors** (there are MANY ways to do this, but we're only going to look at one)

### Useful HTML examples

* [Formatting with bold, italic, etc](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=text-formatting)
* [Creating headings of different importance](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=headings)


Pause for a moment and go to each one of those links. Change ONE thing about ONE of them. What happens?

This is your first interaction with the online tool we'll be using for a lot of the week. Feel free to play around with it! If you have any questions, curiosities, etc, definitely flag down an instructor or put your red post-it on your computer!

Can you make other text in the left hand window bold, or italic, or underlined? Can you create a new heading?

* [Inserting line breaks in text](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=insert-line-breaks)
* [Creating an un-ordered/bulletpoint list - like this one here!](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=unordered-list)
* [Creating a numbered list](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=ordered-list)
* [Creating an HTML Table](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=table )

Pause here. Choose one of those links you want to try out yourself. Can you create a new list, or a table, with data you want it to include?

Remember -- put the red post-it on your computer or flag down an instructor if you're having any trouble or have questions!

* [Including a link (like this!) and an image](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=a-tag )

* [Styling with colors](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_inline)
  * (Note that what you have to write to put colors in your HTML is called "CSS" when you read about it in these examples -- it stands for "Cascading Style Sheets", but we're going to do the "CSS" writing to assign colors to parts of the page *right in the HTML*, like in this example.)

These things are a little trickier.

The images and links you'll definitely have another chance to try in a moment, but feel free to check out that example yourself!

In the latter example, we're using a slightly different tool (because it has exactly the example we want to show you!). You can put this EXACT HTML into the other tool, too!

Colors can be referred to with names like "blue" or "red" -- in the computer, they're represented by different kinds of numbers together, like you saw with Scratch, but HTML is set up so that you can use these English words!

But each word only goes with ONE particular shade.

If you want to be really specific, you can use special letter and number codes that represent different numbers. Let's check out [this tool](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) ... https://htmlcolorcodes.com/

### Try the following:

* Change the color in [this example](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_inline) to red instead of blue

* Choose a color from https://htmlcolorcodes.com/ to change the text to

* If you finish that before we all get back together, try putting in a new header -- maybe an `<h3>` -- and make it a color that you choose from https://htmlcolorcodes.com/ !
