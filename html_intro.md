## Introduction to HTML

* A "markup language"

* Way of designing the structure of a web page

* Any web page you see -- HTML ... AND often a bunch of other stuff making things happen in the background, allowing you to interact with it
  * This week you'll see some of those pieces
  * First, just HTML

* Syntax & syntax errors possible here

* Syntax of "tags" that make structure / formatting / images appear

* A general reference for HTML: https://www.w3schools.com/html/
  * (Coding -- all about looking things up and figuring stuff out -- NOT memorizing)

### HTML helps you work several primary things on web pages

- **Formatting** - making text **bold**, *italic*, <u>underlined</u>...

- **Structure** - making paragraphs in text, line breaks, or lists, like this
  - A key part of programming: Can't take anything for granted, even line breaks!

- Include **images** and **links** in a web page

- **Identify parts** of the page with "ids" and "classes"
  - (So that later on, it's easy to identify part of the web page to change something about it or make something interactive happen to it -- e.g. if you click it, the page turns red!)
  
- **Styling** the page with **colors** (there are MANY ways to do this, but we're only going to look at one)

* [Creating an un-ordered/bulletpoint list - like this one here!](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=unordered-list)
* [Creating a numbered list](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=ordered-list)
* [Creating an HTML Table](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=table )
* [Including a link (like this!) and an image](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=a-tag )
* [Styling with colors](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp)
  * (Note that what you have to write to put colors in your HTML is called "CSS" when you read about it in these examples -- it stands for "Cascading Style Sheets", but we're going to do the "CSS" writing to assign colors to parts of the page *right in the HTML*, like in this example.)
