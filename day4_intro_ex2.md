## **Exercise 2**

As you heard about on Monday, there are TONS of kinds of structure you can do with HTML -- and unfortunately, we don't have anything like enough time to cover them all! Here's a useful one, though: creating a *button* to click on a page.

Check out this HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <title>Example of HTML button</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <br>
  <button id="btn-one">Click on me</button>
</body>
</html>  
```

To see what the result looks like, go back to [this link](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=simple-document) to see the online tool -- delete everything in the left box, and copy and paste in THIS HTML, just like you did before. [Click this link to go see the step by step instructions of how to do that in Exercise 1](day4_intro_ex1.md).

OR, if you'd rather do this in your own files, like you saw before, and will do more of later --  you can open up a new file in the **Sublime Text** program, and copy this HTML in, and save it as a file name like `new_html_button.html` -- make sure the name ends with **.html**! THEN,

Open up your Chrome web browser, go to File -> Open, and select the file called `new_html_button.html` from your file system. (Then you should be able to see the results in your browser!)

### **When you see the results...**

Wow -- a button. *Don't worry that clicking on the button doesn't do anything -- that's EXACTLY what is supposed to happen.*

* NOW, **Change the HTML code to make the button display something else -- besides "Click on me".** What do you have to change to make that happen?

* **You'll notice that there's a special id attribute in the button tag.** Why might you want to identify parts of a page structure with an *id* -- do you remember what we talked about on Monday? (Go on to the next exercise for more on this.)


*Also note...*

The button is pretty cool. But you can't do anything with it! (Yet.)

Learning how to use special JavaScript tricks (and, if you keep programming, a lot more tricks in JavaScript, HTML, and other languages of all kinds) can help you -- for example -- write code that makes something happen when you click a button (instead of just when the page loads!).

We're going to be looking at an example or two like that a little bit later today, too.
