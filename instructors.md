##### Jackie Cohen - Curriculum Director
<img width='10%' height='10%' src="/imgs/mepic_crop2_headshot.png">  <font size="1">Jackie Cohen teaches and designs computing courses, mostly in Southeast Michigan and New York City. She used to be a software engineer at a startup, and now she builds stuff to help people learn about coding. She has a Masters degree in Information Science from the University of Michigan, where she is now a Lecturr III. She loves seeing live music, hiking, and traveling (once she climbed down a canyon in Utah after five feet of snow had fallen -- not advisable, but worth it).</font>
