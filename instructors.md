<img width='10%' height='10%' src="/imgs/mepic_crop2_headshot.png">
<font size="1">Jackie Cohen teaches and designs computing courses, mostly in Southeast Michigan and New York City. She used to be a software engineer at a startup, and now she builds stuff to help people learn about coding. She has a Masters degree in Information Science from the University of Michigan, where she is now a Lecturer. She loves seeing live music, hiking, and traveling (once she climbed down a canyon in Utah after five feet of snow had fallen -- not advisable, but worth it).</font>

##### Rachel Sobel - Head Teacher
<font line-height="1" size="1">Rachel Sobel narrowly escaped a lifetime of biology research by enrolling in the Computer Science program at the University of Washington. Since then, she's worked at Google and Cornell Tech, taught a wide variety of students, and written a novel. She lives with her girlfriend and two very small bears, and loves to listen to Florence + the Machine and Jacob Banks on infinite repeat.<font size="1">
