Yesterday each of your teams designed a prototype of a piece of technology you might build to help address a specific problem.

Today you're going to dive into more development and coding by approaching a minimum viable product, the way you discussed yesterday!

This is part 2 of the **product design cycle** -- at the end of the day today you'll be preparing your presentation, and tomorrow (Friday) you'll be presenting your idea as a team!

### Introductions

* Julia Sterling, your instructor

### Standup, Part 2 & Coding exercises

We've provided a few more code exercises that build off what you did on Monday, and which will help you do some more fun & interesting stuff in your development today.

* [Coding exercises](day_4_exercise_1.md) - Three different exercises are linked here.

You should try to work on these with your coding partner.

Each team will also get a few minutes to come present the standup ideas & plans you came up with yesterday to Julia to talk about them.

### Development: Part 1

* [Introduction to jQuery](day_4_exercise_2.md)

### ~ Lunch ~

### Development: Part 2

* [Choose your development adventure](day_4_exercise_3.md)


### Reflection break

*Run the group function* - [Remember the group rearrange function?](group_function.md)

* Now, after having run that, another simple operation: combine YOUR new group with another group

* Pair up with someone from a different group (OK to have 3 people in one group if there's an uneven number)

*We'll pass out worksheets...*

* In your pair, discuss these three questions about the process so far:

  * What are you worried about?
  * What do you feel confident about now that you didn't before Monday?
  * What's (at least) one thing you're excited to learn (eventually) that you don't know yet?

  Write down the answers on a worksheet!


### Wrap-up & demo discussion

* We've provided the [structure of a Google presentation](google_presentation.md)
* [Exercise - Getting ready to present as a team](day_4_presentation_prep.md)

### Conclusion & Exit Tickets

* Reminders about tomorrow
* See you at Roosevelt Island!
