Yesterday each of your teams designed a prototype of a piece of technology you might build to help address a specific problem.

Today you're going to dive into more development!

At the end of the day today you'll be preparing your presentation, and tomorrow (Friday) you'll be presenting your idea as a team!

#### Development time

[Choose your development adventure - build one or more features!](https://witny-summer-guild-2018.github.io/day_4_exercise_3.html)

**REMEMBER:** Click the arrow to download a file from the online tool!

* It is OK to work in Sublime Text if you want, but we recommend working in the online tool -- easier to see the updates!

* If there is an error in your JavaScript, you won't see what you expect -- and probably will have to debug it, like you practiced on Monday!

* The online tool does NOT auto-save -- you have to copy and/or download any code that you want to save!

* We've only shown you a small amount of things. Much more is possible! Reach out to instructors if you feel good about what you're doing and want more resources and we can help you find useful ones (some are confusing, and some are great)

* Checking out the resources from [Monday](monday.md) may also be helpful, and don't forget about the resources on this page and the exercises you did today!

* It's OK to write different pieces of code among different pairs!


#### **BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY:**

##### [Your presentations and your final reminders](final_reminders.md)

#### Building your own demo!

* We've provided the [structure of a Google presentation](google_presentation.md)
* Getting ready to present for 5 minutes
  * Just a couple decisions to make

### Conclusion & Exit Tickets

* Reminders about tomorrow - location, timing
* See you at Roosevelt Island!
