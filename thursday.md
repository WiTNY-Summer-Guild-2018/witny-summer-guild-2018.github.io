### Resources for today that we'll use in multiple development exercises

[CodeLAB online tool](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=html&file=simple-document) -- **http://bit.ly/codelabtool**

--> *Your development should take place in this CodeLAB tool. Remember to copy the code before refreshing the page, and use the download arrow to save a file with the code. The tool does NOT autosave!*

[Color Picker Tool for CSS](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) - Helps you find specific colors -- not just the shades that go with words like "green" or "pink"

#### Coding review

[Rock Paper Scissors code from Monday](http://bit.ly/RPScode) -- **http://bit.ly/RPScode** -- if you want to check it out again

#### Coding exercises & sharing standup

Make sure to read the instructions/information on each page as you work on it in your pair(s)!

#### jQuery introduction

jQuery is what will help you build things that DO stuff -- e.g. if you click a button, something happens, changes, appears -- things that are a little more interactive. You'll be learning a little bit about using jQuery today!

[jQuery overall reference & tutorial (references from slides in a document you can read)](https://witny-summer-guild-2018.github.io/day_4_exercise_2.html)

[jQuery example code (to copy and try out)](jquery_ex_code.md)

[jQuery click example (on CodeLAB)](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=jquery&file=execute-a-function-on-click-event) There are lots more examples where that came from -- we'll point you to them!

#### Development time

[Choose your development adventure - build one or more features!](https://witny-summer-guild-2018.github.io/day_4_exercise_3.html)

**REMEMBER:** Click the arrow to download a file from the online tool!

* If there is an error in your JavaScript, you won't see what you expect -- and probably will have to debug it, like you practiced on Monday!

* The online tool does NOT auto-save -- you have to copy and/or download any code that you want to save!

* We've only shown you a small amount of things. Much more is possible! Reach out to instructors if you feel good about what you're doing and want more resources and we can help you find useful ones (some are confusing, and some are great).

* Checking out the resources from [Monday](monday.md) may also be helpful, and don't forget about the resources on this page and the exercises you did today!

* It's OK to write different pieces of code among different pairs!


#### **BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY:**

##### [Your presentations and your final reminders](final_reminders.md)

#### Building your own demo!

* We've provided the [structure of a Google presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_C5d6nygVKWSTb5hbsLovjff6FepnbU3OkBZTZtBVSc/edit?usp=sharing)
* Getting ready to present for 5 minutes

### Conclusion & Exit Tickets

* Reminders about tomorrow
