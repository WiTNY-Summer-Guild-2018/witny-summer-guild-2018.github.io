## DAY 3 - Development!

Yesterday each of your teams designed a prototype of a piece of technology you might build to help address a specific problem.

Today you're going to dive into more development and coding by approaching a minimum viable product, the way you discussed yesterday!

This is part 2 of the **product design cycle** -- at the end of the day today you'll be preparing your presentation, and tomorrow (Friday) you'll be presenting your idea as a team!

### Introductions

* Julia Sterling, your instructor

### Standup, Part 2 & Coding exercises

We've provided some step - by - step puzzles with code that will help you do some more fun & interesting stuff in your development today.

Everyone has the same files [TBA TBA]. You should try to work on these as a team -- each time will also get a few minutes to come present the standup ideas & plans you came up with yesterday to Julia to talk about them.

* [Coding exercises](day_4_exercise_1.md)

### Development: More on Control structures & Functions

* [Introduction to more complicated JavaScript](day_4_exercise_2.md)
* [Introduction to jQuery](day_4_exercise_3.md)
* [Interactive exercises](day_4_exercise_4.md)

### Reflection break

*Group function*

* Now another simple operation: combine with another group

* Pair up with someone from another group (3 people in one group if uneven number)

*We'll pass out worksheets...*

* In your pair, discuss these three questions about the process so far:

  * What are you worried about?
  * What do you feel confident about now that you didn't before Monday?
  * What's (at least) one thing you're excited to learn (eventually) that you don't know yet?

  Write down the answers on a worksheet!


### ~ Lunch ~

### Putting a website on the internet

* Select: Your file from Monday vs The file you are working on today!

* [Create a GitHub account](github_account_instructions.md)

* Follow these [instructions for uploading your files to the internet](instructions.md) -- work together and let an instructor know if you run into any problems!

### Wrap-up & demo discussion

* We've provided the [structure of a Google presentation](google_presentation.md) - TBA
* [Exercise - Getting ready to present as a team](day_4_presentation_prep.md)

### Conclusion & Exit Tickets

* Reminders about tomorrow
* See you at Roosevelt Island!
