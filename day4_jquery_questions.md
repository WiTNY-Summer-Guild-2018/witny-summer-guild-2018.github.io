## Questions to ask about each example you choose

* What does this example do?

* Can you identify 1 - 3 lines of code that look familiar in this code?

* Which lines in this example web page are JavaScript code? Which lines are HTML? (e.g. *Lines 1 - 10 are HTML, lines 11- 17 are JavaScript...* )

* Why does this example seem relevant to your prototype idea (in any very small way!)?

* How would you like this example to be different?

  * Different color? Or colors? (Some kinds of coloring can be complicated, some are much easier! We can help you figure out which is which, but for now, come up with the dream, and we'll scope down from there.)

  * Should it do something additional?

  * Should it do something different? How so? Can you explain?

  * Should it do less?

*Try to be specific to this example -- if you want something ELSE interactive to happen that is completely different, it might be good to check out the other examples and select another one.

Even if this example isn't exactly like what you want to do, but you still want to try it out, that's fine!*
