## Introduction to coding: Scratch

### First

* Open up the Chrome web browser so you can type in a web address

### To use Scratch, [go to this website](http://scratch.mit.edu) -- **scratch.mit.edu**

Then, click "Try it out", which looks like this:

### Scratch...

- A programming language that a lot of people like to start with --

- A nice **graphical user interface** -- we can point, click, etc.

- A language with discrete, individual steps.

- Gives you the ability to make complex programs!

That icon you see on the page is called "Scratchy the Cat" -- and a good way to start using the Scratch programming language is to make this "Scratchy the Cat" icon do things: move, draw in different colors...

### Let's look at an example

* Drawing a 'W' for WiTNY
* Drawing a 'W' ... over and over again in different colors!
  * HINT: Colors are represented to Scratch / in the computer by numbers, so...

### Takeaways

* You have to tell the program how it should *start* (e.g. When the green flag is clicked...)

* The program will always do EXACTLY what you tell it to... no more, no less. This is super frustrating! But it is also super powerful when you have a lot of practice.

* How many times do you want it to happen?

* How can you make a plan about what you want to do -- and then make it happen?

### Try it yourself!

* How can you change what we did?
* What will you do to make your own?

The easiest way to *run* these Scratch programs you are working on -- by getting to e.g. click the green flag, and then see the *output*, the result of running the program -- is on this website, **scratch.mit.edu**.

We'll come back to ways of re-using and saving code later! For now, we'll just create and look at output in the web browser (Chrome, for example, that we're using).
