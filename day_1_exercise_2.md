## Introduction to coding: Scratch

### First

* Open up the Chrome web browser so you can type in a web address

### To use Scratch, [go to this website](http://scratch.mit.edu) -- **scratch.mit.edu**

Then, click "Try it out", which looks like this:

### Scratch...

- A programming language that a lot of people like to start with --

- A nice **graphical user interface** -- we can point, click, etc.

- A language with discrete, individual steps.

- Gives you the ability to make complex programs!

That icon you see on the page is called "Scratchy the Cat" -- and a good way to start using the Scratch programming language is to make this "Scratchy the Cat" icon do things: move, draw in different colors...

### Tricks & details of programming (in Scratch, and generally)

* Possible actions (left) vs program panel (right)
* Numbers describe places and colors
* Places: Use the mouse to move Scratchy the Cat...
* Colors: Options
* Controlling programs:
  * Gotta tell a program *when to start*
  * The things that happen go in order
  * The only way to clear the output from a Scratch program is to use the *clear* action...
* Computers do *exactly what you tell them* -- nothing more, nothing less


### Let's look at an example (follow along yourself)

* Drawing a square
* Drawing a square... over and over again in different colors!

### Try it yourself

* **Get into a coding group: pick a partner in your team to work with, and choose 1 computer to work on together!** (Teams of 5 should have 1 coding group of 3.)

* Try to write a program to draw a W (for WitNY!).

* If you finish that, change your program so it draws a W -- 3 times, in a different color each time!

* If you finish that, try to use Scratch to draw something else -- whatever you want! What do you want the program drawing output to be?

* Find out: What happens when you change something in your program? What happens? What might you want to change? -- remember, *only one thing* at a time to be able to figure out how to solve the problems most clearly

### Useful stuff to remember, to use this later...

The easiest way to *run* these Scratch programs you are working on -- by getting to e.g. click the green flag, and then see the *output*, the result of running the program -- is on this website, **[scratch.mit.edu](http://scratch.mit.edu)**.

We'll come back to ways of re-using and saving code later! For now, we'll just create and look at output in the web browser (Chrome, for example, that we're using).
