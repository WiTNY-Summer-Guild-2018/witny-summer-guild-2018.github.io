## How to copy (and paste) text from one place to another

1. Highlight EVERYTHING that you want to copy. Sometimes you can do that by double-clicking in the box where the text you want to highlight is. You can also always click in the place the text you want to highlight is, and then hold the **Control** key, and press the **A** key.

2. Without pressing or clicking *anything* else, if you are holding the **Control** key, now press the **C** key. Copied!  *OR*, you can go to the menu at the top of the screen and click Edit > Copy.

3. Now, go to the window where you want to *paste* that content. Click in the place where you want it to go. (If you want to get rid of everything already there first, highlight it all, and press delete, before you do anything else.)

4. Now, ready to paste what you most recently copied! You can go to the menu and click Edit > Paste, *OR* you can hold the **Control** key and press the **V** key.

All set!

If you have not done this before, this can be a little confusing at first. Don't worry! Flag down a TA/instructor so we can help you out.
