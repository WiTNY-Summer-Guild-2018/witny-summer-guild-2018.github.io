### A group function -- function called `discussionGroup`

*A group of actions to perform -- to get a result!*

* Start in your teams

* If your team name is longer than 8 letters, sort yourselves by first name, alphabetically A-Z, standing...

* Else (otherwise), sort yourselves by height, shortest to tallest

* If you're in the first two (the three shortest, or the three earliest in the alphabet by first name) people in your group, you should go one group clockwise

Now you have new groups of people at tables of about the same size as your old ones!

Each table keeps its original team name -- that's where your team lives!
