### A group function -- function called `new_group`

*A group of actions to perform -- to get a result!*

* Start in your teams
* If your team name is longer than 12 letters, sort yourselves by first name, alphabetically A-Z, standing... *(for example)*
* Else (otherwise), sort yourselves by height, shortest to tallest *(for example)*
* If you're in the first three (the three shortest, or the three earliest in the alphabet by first name) people in your group, you should go one group clockwise

Now you have new groups of about the same size as your old ones!
